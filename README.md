# Bulk and Grain Boundary Diffusivity Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts bulk and grain boundary diffusivity using machine learning techniques.

## Contents

- **`diffData.csv`**: Dataset containing time, distance, and diffusion type labels (`Db` for Bulk, `Dgb` for Grain Boundary).
- **`classifier.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for classifying diffusion types based on the provided dataset.
- **`diffusivity_predictor.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook focused on predicting diffusivity values.
